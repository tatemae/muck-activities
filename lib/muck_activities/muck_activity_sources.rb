  module InstanceMethods

    # +add_activity+ adds an activity to all activites feeds that belong to the objects found in feed_to.
    # * +feed_to+: an array of objects that have +has_activities+ declared on them.  The generated activity
    #   will be pushed into the feed of each of these objects.
    # * +source+: the object that peformed the activity ie a user or group
    # * +item+: an object that will be used to generated the entry in an activity feed
    # * +template+: name of an partial that will be used to generated the entry in the activity feed.  Place
    #   templates in /app/views/activity_templates
    # * +title+: optional title that can be used in the template
    # * +content+: option content that can be used in the template.  Useful for activities that might not have
    #    an item but instead might have a message or other text.
    # * +check_method+: method that will be called on each item in the feed_to array.  If the method evaluates
    #   to false the activity won't be added to the object's activity feed.  An example usage would be
    #   letting users configure which items they want to have in their activity feed.
    # * +attach_to: In addition, to item the activity can be attached to another object.  This can help
    #   improve performance.  For example, each time an 'entry' recieves a new comment a new comment activity is
    #   added to the muck activity feed.  The comments are also rendered alongside the entries. By attaching the
    #   activity directly to the entry it is easy to pull up all related activities.
